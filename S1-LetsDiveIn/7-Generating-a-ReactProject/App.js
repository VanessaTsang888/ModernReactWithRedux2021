7. Generating a React Project:

Install create-react-app use this command in my terminal: npm install -g create-react-app
Then press the Enter key.

npm: can be used to install lots of different open source JS packages on to my local computer to power projects that I am putting together. I reach out to npm to
download a package called create react app and install it on my local computer. The npm command has many different sub commands associated with it, in which case
I want to install a package so I reference the install sub-command. The -g flag is to install globally on my computer. I'll often use this flag anytime I install
a commandline tool or some program I wish to build to run from my terminal.

Going to learn how JSX works. In the terminal, use this command to create my react app: npx create-react-app jsx

Diamgram: I've screen shot this and inserted into my training notes and used my flip chart to draw this out.

Where possible I want to use ES6. However, 

Bable is included in any create-react-app project.

Where possible I want to use ES6. However, browsers not support ES2016 and above. We need to use Bable to overcome this problem.
Feed my ES6 code and Bable will convert this to ES5 and safely execute in any of the current browsers today.
