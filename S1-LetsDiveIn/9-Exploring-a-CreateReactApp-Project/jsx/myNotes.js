9. Exploring a Create-React-App Project:

I create new fold named: jsx since this is about the jsx syntax.
The files insdie this fold is auto generated.

When I create a React App, by default I will get some files:


src: stands for source > will not use any of the auto generated code inside of here.

The nodes modules directory:
A lot of files here and I don't need to go into here.

The package.json files lists out all the dependancies my projects requires and some project configs inside of it. Over time I will be
doing several updates to this package.json file.

Package-lock.jason: records the exact version of all the dependencies that I installed in my project. Under the dependencies there
are many number of records. 

Readme file: tells me how to run this React App project.

.gitignore file: a reference to the git version control system and lists out the different files and folders that git should ignor
if it's going to be tracking my projet and maintaining a record of all the different changes we're making to our codebase.
