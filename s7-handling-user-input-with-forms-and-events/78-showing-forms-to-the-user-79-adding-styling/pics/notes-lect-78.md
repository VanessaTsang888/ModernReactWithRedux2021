# 78 Showing Forms to the User

Continue with the root level set up on my project.

- The goal is to show a search bar which will be a text input at the top of the web page.
- For the SearchBar component, I need to create a 'class based component rather' rather than a functional component since I'm not using the React Hooks System as yet but just the normal state (will learn Hooks later in this course).
- Use the forms tag to develop the text input.
- Look very plain but will inject a little styling in next video.
- Then in the App.js file -> App component -> here I can import the SearchBar component and within the jsx I can replace the App text with the SearchBar component within the return keyword.
- I have ran my app to test it in the UI and test passed as expected - see my screen shot.
