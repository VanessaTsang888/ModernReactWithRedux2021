# App Overview

**Stuff to Still Figure Out**

1. User Events.

How do we get feedback from the user?

- handling user events like a user clicking on something or typing on something or dragging something around on the screen etc.
- So how to react or deal with user events.

2. Fetching Data.

How do we fetch data from some outside API or server?

- This is what happens in the real-world (rather than using our makeup mock data) and pull data from some DB.
- How to fetch data inside of a React App.

3. Showing Lists.

How do we show lists of records?

- Render a list, show a list of data or records.

## Mock up of the React App

Search for cars. V1.

- Show a search input.
- User can type in some text here.
- Do a request to an outside API of pics.
- Show the data on screen to the user.

V1 - phase 1 and phase 2.

More complex as same as before but now how we going to show the data or images -> tile images across the screen as images not all same sizes. Some styling work and intergrate with React code.

**New Project**

- Generate new project.
- cd in to the relevant folder.
- Use this cmd: create-react-app pics
- That cmd didn't work so I used this: npx create-react-app pics
