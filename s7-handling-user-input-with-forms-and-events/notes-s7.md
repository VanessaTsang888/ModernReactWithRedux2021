# Section 7 - Handling User Input with Forms and Events

The lectures within this section is using class based component and state to handle user input but without using the React Hooks System.

Altough I have missed out the previous sections that focuses on writting Class Based Components using state and without Hooks, I feel by completing this section, it will help me understand Hooks easier when I get to Section 12.

Due to time limitations, I have changed my mind and instead of completing this setion 7, I am now going strgight to section 12 as I've found that lecture 149 will teach me how to develop a search bar and to deal with user text input. This lecture is about using useState hook to track state.
