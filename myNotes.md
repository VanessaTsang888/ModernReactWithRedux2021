MY NOTES FOR ALL LECTURES:

SECTION 1:

L7:
$ npm create-react-app [ name of project ]

L10:

cd into [ jsx ]
$ npm start

Stopping the React app:
Press Control + c at the terinal

Starting the app up in the future:
in the project directory run:
$ npm start

Once app started, visit: localhost:3000

Possible errors during npm start:
1. Port in use message (2 apps running same time);
2. localhost:3000 doesn't work (for security reason sometimes this can be blocked). To resolve this issue, when React app starts it
displays 2 addresses that you can use to connect. One local and one network address. Use the network address instead,
example http://192.168.1.187:3000

L11: JS Module Systems:

Delete all existing files from src folder (these were auto generated by create react app command).
Create new file called index.js
Refresh and will see white screen.

L12:
Import statements x2.

L13:
3 steps for create a react component and display on screen.
Refresh the browser to pick up the changes.

SECTION 2:

L16: What is JSX:

Make use of dependencies called Babel to take my ES6 code and convert to ES5 and also to process JSX as well 

L17: Converting Styling to JSX Format:
