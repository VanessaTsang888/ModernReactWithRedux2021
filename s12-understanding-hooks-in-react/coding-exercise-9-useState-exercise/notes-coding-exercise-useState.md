# Coding exercise 9: useState exercise

Refactor the starter code that displays a button and current count displayed. The goal is by default display a number zero by default.
When user clicks the button, increment the number by one.

---

Let's test your knowledge of useState by making a classic counter component.

Your app should show Current Count: 0 when it first starts up. Increment this number by one every time a user clicks on the button.

Here's what you'll need to do:

Call useState at the top of the App component. Remember to provide a default starting value for your piece of state. For this app, provide a default value of 0

When you call useState you get back a state value and a setter. Call the setter inside of onButtonClick and provide a new value for your piece of state

Make sure your H1 element displays the value of your counter piece of state!
