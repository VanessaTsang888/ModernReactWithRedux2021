# Important Note

There appears to be a missing video that aimed to describe what will be built over the next few sections and start the app generation.

To summarize what was to be in this lecture, we will be building a Widget application that will include multiple components. These components will be:

- An Accordion component

- A Wikipedia API search component

- A Dropdown item selection component

- A Google Translate API component

We will then wrap up the Widgets application by building our own navigation using JS and React without a third-party library like React Router. This will be used to navigate between the different widget components that were built.

Before continuing on to the next lecture, make sure to generate the project by running the following:

```
npx create-react-app widgets
```

**_New React App_**

I have create a new react app using the above command in my terminal.

- cd in to the project directory
- ran it in the UI using this cmd: npm start
- I have the default React front page with the React logo spining around.
