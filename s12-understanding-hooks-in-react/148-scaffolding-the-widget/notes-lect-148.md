# 148 Scaffolding the Widget

Start writing code to create the Search component.

1. In component directory create new file called Search.js
2. Import React library. Write the component as an arrow function. Export this component at the bottom.
3. In the App.js file, import the Search component.
4. For now we not going to display the Accordion component. Instead we display our Search component. Then use navigation to wire up all the widgets and allow the user to decide which they want to look at at one given time.
5. I ran this App and the Search text is display on screen as expected.
