# 40 App Overview

At the moment our PDA Web App is static as don't change over time. The users can't interact with it - they can't add/remove cards over time, they can't change images/titles etc. In this section we will develop dynamic content apps where the content on the screen will change as a user interacts with our App.

## Simple Animal App

Very simple App to learn about the React state system.

**_How It Works_**

1. The user simpley click on the btn to add an animal. Then an image of an animal will display on the screen.
2. Anytime user click on an animal, a heart icon will appear next to it as this means the user LIKES that animal.
3. Each click should make the heart larger and larger.

This one simple App includes some important concepts.
