# Introducing the Event System

Add Animal btn > Animals to show: 0 > will increment when user clicks the btn

1. Detect a user clicking the button > Event System.
2. Update content on screen.

## The Code

**_App.js_**
Wire up an event handler. When user clicks btn, the App func gets called due to the onClick Prop within the btn element. The handleClick is a func but we dont need the parenthesis at the end.

### Inspect the UI

Inspect > Consol tab: when user clicks the btn, the text within the console.log is displayed. This proves our Event Handler is working as expected. so we are running a particular func when ever a user interacts with a very particular element.
