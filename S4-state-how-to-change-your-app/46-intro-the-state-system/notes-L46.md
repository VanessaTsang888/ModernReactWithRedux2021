# 46 Introducing the State System

We have learnt that to detect a user clicking the btn we use the React Event System.

Now, to respond to user doing something (event handler) we need to update content on screen using the React State System.

## Data

We need a piece of data in our App and we will call it 'count' which will start at zero. So assign the variable 'count' to 0.

### How the counter works

1. Need some kind of 'count' variable.
2. Should start with a value of 0.
3. Add 1 whenever the user clicks.
4. Whenever the value is changed, update content on screen (rerender our App).
