# Coding Exercise 4 - Events

**_Exercise with Events_**
Goal: Add a click event handler to the button element.

Make sure that whenever the button is clicked, you console.log a message of 'Hello there!'.

App.js

```js
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => console.log("Hello there!")}>Click Me!</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

I clicked the 'Check solution' btn and found out that my refactored code is corret and I passed first time round - see attched screenshot.
