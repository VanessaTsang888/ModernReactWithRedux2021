# 37 Adding CSS Libraries with NPM

1. npm install bulma
2. Use the bulma.css file that is inside of: node_modules > bulma.
3. Loads of free css in this file.
4. Use this file inside of our source files.
5. App.js file > write import statement > must add the extension of '.css' as this is not a JS file.

```js
import "bulma/css/bulma.css";
```

We know the css library has been loaded up correctly as in the UI the font has changed.
