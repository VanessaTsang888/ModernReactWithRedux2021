# Section 1 Let's Dive In.

Lecture 4 - Let's Build An App:

- A translate App.
- User will type their text into the input box or field, this will get translated, then show the outpout at the bottom of the screen.
- When user change their input text, the output will auto change as well.
- The starter files are in: codesandbox.io/s/react-pibc94
- This is an online editor with files and folder already created for me.
- a quick demo project.
- The completed version of the app is here: codesandbox.io/s/react-forked-m5bz37

Write out code without much explaination as the explaination will be on the next video.
