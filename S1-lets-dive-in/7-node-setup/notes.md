# Node Setup

1. Learn more about JSX and components.

2. Code Sand Box is great but not used for professional projects.

3. Generate a new local React project.

I will develop an React App and deploy it.

Step 1:
To start new project I need to do a little set up - install or update node.

- to see if I already have node, run the cmd -> node -v
  If I get a version number, this means I already have node installed.
  I have v.16.14.0 so I don't need to install node.
  If I got back an error it means I need to install node. In Google search Node download -> www.nodejs.org -> download the installer for my OS -> run it -> Go through the staller.
