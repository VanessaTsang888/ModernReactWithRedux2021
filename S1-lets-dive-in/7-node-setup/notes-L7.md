# 7. Node Setup

To check which version of node I have installed on my machine:

- open Terminal (Mac)/ VSCoder Terminal or GitBash (Windows).
- $ node -v
- The output will be something like this: v16.13.0 -> this is the version number.
- This means I already have node install and I don't need to reinstall it. Most modern versions should work with React.
- If I get back an error its likely that I need to install node.

To install node:

- https://nodejs.org > download
- Download node from this site.
- Then run the installer - double click on the node download. This will stall the software.
- In Terminal run this cmd to check node has been installed correctly: node -v
- May need to restart machine before running that cmd?
