## My Environment

**_Editor:_**

VS Code as my code editor - https://code.visualstudio.com/

In this course, you will frequently see my code 'jump', or reformat itself whenever I save a file. This is done automatically by https://prettier.io/

**_Terminal:_**

I use Iterm2 as my terminal - https://www.iterm2.com/

Inside my terminal, I run the shell https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh with the default theme 'Robby Russell'
