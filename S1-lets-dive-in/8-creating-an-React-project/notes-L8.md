# 8. Creating a React project

Once I've installed node and check that it has been installed correct using below cmd then I can generate a new React project:

`$ node-v`
Current my note is on version: 16.15.0

To generate a project use this cmd ->
`npx ceate-react-app <project name>`

The npx is a tool to create the React App.
I'm going to learn about jsx so my project is going to be called: jsx
so my cmd is: `npx ceate-react-app jsx`
The installation process will take a couple of mins. Once done will see a new folder inside of my current directory.
Now cd into this new jsx project directory and install node moduels: `npm i`

1. Run the cmd: `npm start`
2. React App will auto open in my browser.
3. To stop my project from running press: ctrl + C
4. The frontend is: localhost:3000 -> this will take me back to my App.

I've already done all of the above in the past and will not do it again, just watch the video to refresh my memory.
