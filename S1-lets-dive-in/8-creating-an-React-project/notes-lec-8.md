# Create a new React project

To generate a project use this cmd ->
`npx ceate-react-app <project name>`

I'm going to learn about jsx so my project is going to be called: jsx
so my cmd is: npx ceate-react-app jsx
The installation process will take a couple of mins. Once done will see a new folder inside of my current directory.
Now cd into this new jsx project directory.

1. Run the cmd: npm start
2. React App will auto open in my browser.
3. To stop my project from running just press ctrl + c
4. The frontend is: localhost:3000 -> this will take me back to my app
