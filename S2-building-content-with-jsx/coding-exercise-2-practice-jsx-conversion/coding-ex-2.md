# Practice JSX Conversion:

Remember the five rules of converting HTML to JSX.

All prop names follow camelCase capitalization

Number attributes use curly braces

Booleans of 'true' can be written with just the property name

The 'class' attribute is written as 'className'

In-line styles are provided as objects

The JSX below is breaking all five rules. Fix the JSX to make sure it is valid.

See App.js for my code.
