# 22 - Application Overview:

We going to put together a little app to better understand the 3 diferent terms.

We'll develop an app to make a couple of react components that are going to generate what looks like a list of comments, on a blog post or a song, a news article, whatever it might be. Display:

1. An image.
2. Name.
3. time.
4. The comment text.

They look similar to each other in terms of styling, just differnt text.

# Generate new project in the terminal:
