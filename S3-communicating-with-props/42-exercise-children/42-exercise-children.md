# 42 Exercise Children

**Intro**

We have one App component and then a lot more JSX code as this time we have two segments as we can see in the UI -> rounded corners and gray background is same for both segment but the content is different.

The Task
Look at the jsx and workout how to extract the thing that is giving us the styling into a separate component. Hint: only extract the duplicated jsx. So i'll have an additional component that can be reused in the future. Render child component inside of the new component -> we reference prop.Children
