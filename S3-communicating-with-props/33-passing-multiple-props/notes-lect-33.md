# 33 Passing Multiple Props

React prop system, continued...
Syntax around passing a prop from a parent down to a child.

index.js file

```js
<CommentDetail author='Sam' />
```

So the property we are passing down is the author's name.

- CommentDetail -> component that we are showing as a child, we going to receive that prop data inside the arrow function as the first argument that we refer to as the property object. Then we make use of this data inside of the child inside of the child component: {props.author}

This lecture will go through that exact same series of steps to update our time and the blog content and make sure those data can be customised from the parent.

- index.js -> write our new property here
- CommentDetail -> inside span tag: Print out date/time. Use braces to reference a JS variable.
  I'm not sure if that is a variable as I feel its just the prop of timeAgo?
  This will display different date/time in the UI.
- I have ran the app and I can see the new updated date/time - see my screen shot.

## Post Comment

Use props for the post comment by passing from parent to child.
Start with the index.js file. Then in the CommentDetail component file, use braces to receive the data from index.js file - the parent.

### The Task

Use prop for the post comment and the image generated by faker.
**image**
Extract this image url. Customise an attribute on jsx element using a prop.

- index file (parent) -> avatar={faker.image.image()}

CommentDetail file (child)

```js
<img alt='avatar' src={props.avatar} />
```

I've made sure images are dynamically generated by in the UI -> click the refresh icon next to the url. This works as expected - see my screen shot. Now, i've passed data from parent to child using the React props system.
