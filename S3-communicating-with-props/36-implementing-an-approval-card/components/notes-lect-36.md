# 36 Implementing an Approval Card

Create new component called ApprovalCard.js

1. Boiler plate code: import statement.
2. For the Approval card component - use const to desclare an arrow function called ApprovalCard.
3. At the bottom write the export default statement so we can make use of this component in other files inside of our project.
4. Write jsx code inside of the ApprovalCard component.
5. Borrow some style from the Semantic UI library so we dont need to write the css myself: https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html
   Scroll down to: Cards section and copy the code. This is what we want to build. So we use this to build the card then worry about how we going to sub-in custome content. 6. For now just write some hardcoded text so we can test in the UI.
6. Once the import statement and the ApprovalCard child component is in the index.js file, we can test in the UI.

I have tested my code in the UI and works as expected. See my screen shot.
