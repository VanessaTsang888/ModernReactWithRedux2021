# 22 - Application Overview:

We going to put together a little app to better understand the 3 diferent terms.

We'll develop an app to make a couple of react components that are going to generate what looks like a list of comments, on a blog post or a song, a news article, whatever it might be. Display:

1. An image.
2. Name.
3. time.
4. The comment text.

They look similar to each other in terms of styling, just differnt text.

# Generate new project in the terminal:

1. Generate a new React aap -> npx create-react-app

## 23 Semantic UI CDN Link:

In the upcoming lecture, we will be getting the link for the Semantic UI CDN to put in our index.html. Since some students have been confused about which link to get I am placing it here for easy access:

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css"
/>

## 24 Getting Some Free Styling:

cd into the project folder component and run the app with: npm start.

- src directory: delect all files here.

Task 1: create one component with all data.

- We use css library to take care of the styling for us.
- Semantic UI cdn is an open source css framework:

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css"
/>

Past this link inside of the index.htl file -> within <head> tag, at end of the meta tags.
