# 21 - Three Tenets of Components;

The three tenets of the react ecosystem. They are going to govern how we design our react applications.

1. Component Nesting: A cmponent can be shown inside of another.

- Nesting -> place them inside each other.

2. Component Resuability: We want to make components that can be easily reused through out applications.

- e.g. we develop a button component so they are reusable.

3. Component Configuration: We should be able to configure a component when it is created.

- a button need to be customised in some very specific way. One btn may have the text: Submit, another may have text: Click On Me. And both may need to do different things. so when btn is created we need to make sure they can be customisable.
