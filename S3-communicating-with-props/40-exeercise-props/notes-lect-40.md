# Test Your Knowledge: Props

Intro to the exercise in next section.

We have a component called App and a component called Message.
There is two pieces of hardcoded plain text. I need to make them more reusable.
We need to pass in the first piece of text. For second piece of text we updae as props when we create the Message component inside of the App.

Read instructions before refactoring the code.
